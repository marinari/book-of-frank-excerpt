##Untitled, Pg 101: _Book of Frank_ by CA Conrad
---

```
Frank was embarrassed in the bar
when his skin began to smoke
```

```
"hey man!" someone yelled
"do you need the fire department?"
```

```
everybody laughed
```

```
"no" he said with 
a nervous smile waving
his arm to 
clear the smoke
which only made it worse
```

```
"it will pass" he said
```

```
"it's just the 
condition 
of my Soul
```

```
it will pass"
```
